# Libft - The first project at 42
Quite an interesting experience due to the ammount of functions we had to make.
Some of them (ft_split, ft_itoa and ft_strtrim) made me have a hard time and had to ask for my colleagues help.
All in all, very usefull project since its going to be used for the rest of the CommonCore.

This project was graded 100/100!
