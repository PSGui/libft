# Libft - The first project that I did at 42
Quite an interesting experience due to the ammount of functions we had to make. Some of them (ft_split, ft_itoa and ft_strtrim) made me have a hard time and had to ask for my colleagues help.
All in all, very usefull project since its going to be used for the rest of the CommonCore.
